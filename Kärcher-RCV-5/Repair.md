## Repair of the water pump

### Situation and problem
A few weeks ago, I bought a Kärcher RCV 5 in its original packaging but without a receipt on eBay, which after a few days only swept on one side and then stopped sweeping/wiping altogether. The wiper remained dry.
I tried to find the problem step by step: The nozzles above the mop were clear, the water connection on the water tank was working and no air was sucked in. I had suspected that the ventilation of the tank might be insufficient, creating a vacuum when water is removed. However, I was able to rule that out as well. As a last resort, I suspected the water pump.

### Repair
I took the vacuum cleaner apart, located the pump, removed it and tested it externally to see if it was working. It was indeed not working.

The water pump (model number CJWP08-AB03A2) is constructed in "layers" so that it can be further disassembled. Under the top cover with the water connections, I removed the spring-loaded steel ball and put it back in. I also removed the connection to the motor, operated it manually a few times, and put it back together. After that, the pump worked again.

Then I soldered the pump back in place and reassembled the vacuum cleaner. After the repair, the robot wiped perfectly again. In pure wiping mode (without vacuuming), the sound of the water pump could be heard again at regular intervals. If the pump stops working again, I would buy a new one and install it, as they are very inexpensive.

Hopefully, my experience will help somebody with the same or a similar problem on the Kärcher RCV 5.
